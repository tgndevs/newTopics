General discussion for future meetups

Comes from the idea of seeking a way to view and exchange whatches on interests that are arising for future meetups, weigh, assess contents and adapt them to the expectations of the members.

The initial idea is to use issues, etc to go counting the interests and approaches to future presentations.
